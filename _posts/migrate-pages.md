# The past

A couple of years ago I have created personal web pages and blog on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). At that time it
was the fastest way how to crate and start personal pages. So I was impressed.

# Why I left

With the time I started feeling a bit uncomfortable when I needed to customize some advanced parts. One have to dive
into the WordPress structure
and themes. Then requirement for any advanced styling is usually for an extra money.

As a software craftsman I started to feel be chained to that platform. So I was thinking about something lightweight,
portable, playful to write and easy to move from hosting to hosting.

So it begins...

# What's my choice

I found really awesome statically
generated [starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) using Next.js, Markdown and
TypeScript/React.

And that's exactly that what I was looking for :

* Write **content as markdown** managed by Remark and focus on your content - *content first*.
* Update template by using **[React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)** - *play with the web development*.
* Save the content and the code to **GitHub** - *keep your pages easy to move*.

# The future

I feel that I experience a lot of interesting stories in my Android software craftsmanship. Those stories are usually
forgotten in the time. But I feel it might be helpful for others to write them down to blog and keep them available also
as the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/kotoMJ/kotox-android)

And that's it. This is my first story. See you on the next one ;-)

Happy coding
MJ
