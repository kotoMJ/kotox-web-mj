# Nextjs Starter steps

Local first time:
1) At the very first run: `npm install`

Local any dev session:
1) Run: `next` which will start pages locally and will automatically update any changes. Just reload page to see it.


Remote server (e.g. rosti) first time
1) Ensure you have enough memory on the machine for first build (eventually temporarily increase)
2) `npm install`
3) For production Image Optimization with Next.js, the optional `sharp` package is strongly recommended. Run `yarn add sharp`, and Next.js will use it automatically for Image Optimization.
4) `npm run build`

Remote server any update
1) `npm run build`
2) `supervisorctl restart app`  (rosti.cz specific command to restart the app)


General
1) `npx next -v` checks out version of nextjs. It should be at least 12 for our case.


# NODE Basics
Brew Mac M1
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64963370/error-cannot-install-in-homebrew-on-arm-processor-in-intel-default-prefix-usr
Before installing Brew
1) type `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`
2) install Homebrew for ARM M1 chip:  `arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
3) Once Homebrew for M1 ARM is installed use this Homebrew command to install packages: `arch -x86_64 brew install <package>`
4) install node to the latest `npm install npm@latest -g`


# Notes
When we see this on Rosti: `info  - Linting and checking validity of types .Killed` it means we have low-end package (low memory). Update the package and it will work fine.
