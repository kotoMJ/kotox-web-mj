# The starter platform

A couple of years ago I have created personal website blog with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). It was the
fastest way how to crate and start personal website for me. I was impressed.

# Why I left

During the time I started to feel a bit uncomfortable when I needed to customize some advanced parts. One have to dive
into WordPress specific structure and themes. Don't mention there is the pay-more model with anything advanced.

As a software craftsman **I was chained to that closed platform**. So I was thinking about something lightweight,
portable, playful to code and easy to move from hosting to hosting.

So it begins...

# What's my choice

The idea is to write my own website to be hosted on Node.js

I found really awesome statically
generated [starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) using Next.js, Markdown and
TypeScript/React.

And that's exactly what I was looking for :

* Write **content as markdown** managed by Remark and focus on your content - *content first*.
* Update template by using **[React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)** - *play with the
  web development*.
* Save the content and the code to [**GitHub**](https://github.com/kotoMJ/kotox-web-mj) - *keep your pages easy to move*.

# The new platform

With existing code for the website, it's just matter of Node.js platform hosting.
There is pretty popular [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) platform where to host Node.js code. And there are many
more.

Anyway my favourite local platform is [Rosti](https://rosti.cz/). This platform basically takes care about the
ecosystem, and I can focus on the code and deployment. It's also family like business, so one can always ask for
advice and get personal response. That's exactly my preference.

# Why blog at all

I experience a lot of interesting stories during my Android software craftsmanship. And I feel those stories might help
others when solving similar problems. Or at least deserves to be told.

Therefore, I decided to write them down in a pretty short readable form. And any story will have its own piece of code
on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kotoMJ/kotox-android) monorepo.

# That's it.

This was my first story. Hope you enjoyed it.

See you soon.  
MJ
