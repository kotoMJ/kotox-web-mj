Hi there! **It's me** Michal (aka **MJ**)  - a **Software Engineer** crafting apps in Central Bohemia of Czechia, Europe.
I am focused on **Android** software craftsmanship over past 7 years. Besides that I am
passionated in the full-stack development NodeJS, React, Express and MongoDB. Over and above
that I have over 8 years of experience with Java Enterprise development, when being part of the team
developing [internet banking system](https://login.kb.cz/).
