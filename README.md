Codebase for MJ's personal website and blog. Stories about real life Android craftsmanship.

Big credit to [this awesome template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) using
Next.js, Markdown and React/TypeScript. It is simple codebase with fast content updates. And last but not least its
really playful codebase to update/enhance even for beginners.
